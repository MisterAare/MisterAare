I'm Adegboyega, and I'm a data scientist who also does content on data science and analysis. I really enjoy building machine learning models and running statistical analyses like regression and classification, as well as creating analytic content and freelancing. I also enjoy working with languages and frameworks like Python, TensorFlow, DAX, and SQL, as well as working with Excel. I also enjoy data visualization, cleaning, and analysis in general.
